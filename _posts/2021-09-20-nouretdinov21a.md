title: Conformal changepoint detection in continuous model situations
abstract: Conformal prediction provides a way of testing the IID assumption, which
  is the standard  assumption in machine learning. A natural question is whether this
  way of testing is efficient. A  typical situation where the IID assumption is broken
  is the existence of a changepoint at which the  distribution of the data changes.
  We study the case of a change from one continuous distribution to  another with
  both distributions belonging to standard parametric families. Our conclusion is
  that the  conformal approach to testing the IID assumption is efficient, at least
  to some degree.
