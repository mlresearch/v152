title: Fast conformal classification using influence functions
abstract: We use influence functions from robust statistics to speed up full conformal
  prediction. Traditionally, conformal prediction requires retraining multiple leave-one-out
  classifiers to calculate  p-values for each test point. By using influence functions,
  we are able to approximate this procedure  and to speed up considerably the time
  complexity.
