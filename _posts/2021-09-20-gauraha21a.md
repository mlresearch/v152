title: Synergy conformal prediction
abstract: Conformal prediction is a machine learning methodology that produces valid
  prediction  regions. Ensembles of conformal predictors have been proposed to improve
  the informational  efficiency of inductive conformal predictors by combining p-values,
  however, the validity of such  methods has been an open problem. We introduce synergy
  conformal prediction which is an  ensemble method that combines monotonic conformity
  scores, and is capable of producing valid  prediction intervals. We study the applicability
  in three scenarios; where data is partitioned, where  an ensemble of different machine
  learning methods is used, and where data is unpartitioned. We  evaluate the method
  on 10 data sets and show that the synergy conformal predictor produces valid  prediction
  intervals that on partitioned data performs well compared to the most efficient
  model  trained on individual partitions, making it a viable approach for federated
  settings when data cannot  be pooled. We also show that our method has advantages
  over current ensembles of conformal  predictors by producing valid and efficient
  results on unpartitioned data, and that it is less  computationally demanding.
