title: Evaluation of updating strategies for conformal predictive systems in the presence
  of  extreme events
abstract: Six different strategies for updating split conformal predictive systems
  in an online  (streaming) setting are evaluated. The updating strategies vary in
  the extent and frequency of  retraining as well as in how training data is split
  into proper training and calibration sets. An  empirical evaluation is presented,
  considering passenger booking data from a ferry company, which  stretches over a
  number of years. The passenger volumes have changed drastically during 2020 due  to
  COVID-19 and part of the evaluation is focusing on which updating strategies work
  best under  such circumstances. Some strategies are observed to outperform others
  with respect to continuous  ranked probability score and validity, highlighting
  the potential value of choosing a proper strategy.
