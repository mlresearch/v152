title: 'Impact of model-agnostic nonconformity functions on efficiency of conformal
  classifiers: an extensive study'
abstract: The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy
  rate makes this  framework attractive in various practical applications. However,
  this property is achieved at a price  of reduction in precision. In the case of
  conformal classification, the system can output multiple class  labels instead of
  one. It is also known, that the choice of nonconformity function has a major impact  on
  the efficiency of conformal classifiers. Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic  nonconformity
  functions result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a
  Neural  Network-based conformal classifier, the \emph{inverse probability} (or hinge
  loss) allows minimizing the  average number of predicted labels, and \emph{margin}
  results in a larger fraction of singleton predictions.  In this work, we aim to
  further extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8  different
  classification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship
  holds or  not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the properties
  of these two  nonconformity functions.
