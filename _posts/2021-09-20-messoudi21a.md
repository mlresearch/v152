title: 'Class-wise confidence for debt prediction in real estate management: discussion
  and lessons learned from an application'
abstract: The prediction of tenants likely to fall into a debt situation is a key
  issue for social  property owners in real estate. It is even more important for
  them to limit the number of people  falsely predicted to be in debt to avoid incurring
  unnecessary costs (in time and money), for instance  by sending agents to prevent
  the debt. In this paper, we adapt Mondrian conformal prediction to  control the
  error rate of this class, while keeping a level of confidence chosen by the social
  property  owner, or more generally by the user. We also test this small adaptation
  with different splitting  strategies and discuss the obtained results, those later
  showing promising results, in the sense that  they show that our approach can work,
  as well as pointing out and discussing difficulties, in the  sense that conformal
  prediction fails on some settings of particular interest to the end-user.
