title: Confidence machine learning for cutting tool life prediction
abstract: The work aims to develop an automatic cutting tool life prediction model
  for die-cuts  machine at Parafix. Such model will be able to estimate how long a
  given tool is likely to last, in order  to improve performance and productivity.
  This work is part of the KTP project between Parafix and  University of Brighton.
