title: Approximation to object conditional validity with inductive conformal predictors
abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms that output prediction
  sets that have a  guarantee of marginal validity for finite samples with minimal
  distributional assumptions. This is a property that makes conformal predictors useful
  for machine learning tasks where we  require reliable predictions. It would also
  be desirable to achieve conditional validity in the same  setting, in the sense
  that validity of the prediction intervals remains true regardless of conditioning  on
  any particular property of the object of the prediction. Unfortunately, it has been
  shown that  such conditional validity is impossible to guarantee for non-trivial
  prediction problems for finite  samples. In this article, instead of trying to achieve
  a strong conditional validity guarantee, an  \emph{approximation} to conditional
  validity is considered and measured empirically. A new algorithm is  introduced
  to do this by iteratively adjusting a conformity measure to deviations from object  conditional
  validity measured in the training data. Experimental results are provided for three
  data  sets that demonstrate (1) in real world machine learning tasks, lack of conditional
  validity is a  measurable problem and (2) that the proposed algorithm is effective
  at alleviating this problem.
