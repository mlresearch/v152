title: Shapley-value based inductive conformal prediction
abstract: Shapley values of individual instances were recently proposed for the problem
  of data  valuation. They were defined as the average marginal instance contributions
  to the performance of a  given predictor. In this paper we propose to use Shapley
  values of individual instances as conformity  scores. To compute these values efficiently
  and exactly we employ a standard algorithm based on  nearest neighbor classification
  and propose a variant of this algorithm for clustered data. Both  variants are used
  for computing Shapley conformity scores for inductive conformal predictors. The  experiments
  show that the Shapley-value conformity scores result in smaller prediction sets
  for  significance level $\epsilon \leq 0.1$ compared with those produced by standard
  conformity scores  (i.e. similarity between true and predicted output values).
