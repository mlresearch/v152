title: Mondrian conformal predictive distributions
abstract: The distributions output by a standard (non-normalized) conformal predictive
  system all  have the same shape but differ in location, while a normalized conformal
  predictive system outputs  distributions that differ also in shape, through rescaling.
  An approach to further increasing the  flexibility of the framework is proposed,
  called \emph{Mondrian conformal predictive distributions}, which  are (standard
  or normalized) conformal predictive distributions formed from multiple Mondrian  categories.
  The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with an application to regression  forests.
  By forming categories through binning of the predictions, it is shown that for this
  model  class, the use of Mondrian conformal predictive distributions significantly
  outperforms the use of  both standard and normalized conformal predictive distributions
  with respect to the continuous- ranked probability score. It is further shown that
  the use of Mondrian conformal predictive  distributions results in as tight prediction
  intervals as produced by normalized conformal regressors,  while improving upon
  the point predictions of the underlying regression forest.
