title: A lower bound for a prediction algorithm under the Kullback-Leibler game
abstract: We obtain a lower bound for an algorithm predicting finite-dimensional distributions  (i.e.,
  points from a simplex) under Kullback-Leibler loss. The bound holds w.r.t. the class
  of softmax  linear predictors. We then show that the bound is asymptotically matched
  by the Bayesian universal  algorithm.
