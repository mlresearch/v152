title: Conformal prediction and its integration within visual analytics toolbox
abstract: Conformal prediction is a machine learning approach to report on the reliability
  of  predictive models when applied to new cases. Machine learning techniques are
  gaining in  complexity, and assessing their reliability may be an essential part
  of explaining the inner workings  of predictive models. For practical purposes and
  dissemination of conformal prediction techniques,  we must include these within
  easily accessible toolboxes. In machine learning, a significant subset of  such
  toolboxes is those that use work flows and visual programming. Here, we report on
  an example  of such a toolbox, Python implementation of conformal prediction library,
  and our initial efforts and ideas to democratize conformal prediction.
