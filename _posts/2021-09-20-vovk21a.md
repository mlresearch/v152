title: Conformal testing in a binary model situation
abstract: Conformal testing is a way of testing the IID assumption based on conformal
  prediction.  The topic of this paper is experimental evaluation of the performance
  of conformal testing in a  model situation in which IID binary observations generated
  from a Bernoulli distribution are  followed by IID binary observations generated
  from another Bernoulli distribution, with the  parameters of the distributions and
  changepoint known or unknown. Existing conformal test  martingales can be used for
  this task and work well in simple cases, but their efficiency can be  improved greatly.
