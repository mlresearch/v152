title: Conformal uncertainty sets for robust optimization
abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is hugely important for any decisions
  sensitive to  perturbations in observed data. One method of incorporating uncertainty
  into making optimal  decisions is through robust optimization, which minimizes the
  worst-case scenario over some  \emph{uncertainty set}. We connect conformal prediction
  regions to robust optimization, providing finite  sample valid and conservative
  ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, aptly named conformal uncertainty sets.  In pursuit
  of this connection we explicitly define Mahalanobis distance as a potential conformity  score
  in full conformal prediction. We also compare the coverage and optimization performance
  of  conformal uncertainty sets, specifically generated with Mahalanobis distance,
  to traditional  ellipsoidal uncertainty sets on a collection of simulated robust
  optimization examples.
