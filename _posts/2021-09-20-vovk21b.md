title: 'Retrain or not retrain: conformal test martingales for change-point detection'
abstract: We argue for supplementing the process of training a prediction algorithm
  by setting up  a scheme for detecting the moment when the distribution of the data
  changes and the algorithm  needs to be retrained. Our proposed schemes are based
  on exchangeability martingales, i.e.,  processes that are martingales under any
  exchangeable distribution for the data. Our method, based  on conformal prediction,
  is general and can be applied on top of any modern prediction algorithm.  Its validity
  is guaranteed, and in this paper we make first steps in exploring its efficiency.
