title: A non-conformity approach towards post-prostatectomy metastasis estimation
  using a multicentre prostate cancer database
abstract: Prostate cancer is among the most common type of cancer in men worldwide.
  Despite the use of clinical indicators, as part of simple rule-based strategies,
  stratifying patients diagnosed with prostate cancer into risk groups to reliably
  reflect oncological prognosis remains challenging. Machine Learning (ML) offers
  the possibility to develop estimation models based on routinely evaluated patient
  or tumor characteristics. In the present study, the estimation of metastasis in
  prostate patients after primary treatments (radical prostatectomy) with the aid
  of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conformal Predictors (CP) was evaluated. We
  show that the use of ML models can complement classical statistical approaches.
  Moreover, the application of CP, on top of an underlying ML model, renders a probabilistic
  outcome that combines the simplicity of a clinical indicator with the precision
  of a ML approach. The TriNetX Research Network, an electronic health records database
  with datasets from several United States health care organizations, was used in
  this study. This approach can be further adapted to support clinical decision making
  in prostate and other types of cancer.
