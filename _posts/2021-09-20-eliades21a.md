title: Using inductive conformal martingales for addressing concept drift in data
  stream classification
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of Inductive Conformal Martingales
  (ICM) with the  histogram betting function for detecting the occurrence of concept
  drift (CD) in data stream  classification. A change in the data distribution will
  almost surely affect the performance of our  classification model resulting in false
  predictions. Therefore, a reliable and fast detection of the  point at which a CD
  occurs, allows effective retraining of the model to recover accuracy. Our  approach
  is based on ICM with the histogram betting function, which is much more computationally  efficient
  than alternative ICM approaches. To accelerate the process of detecting CD we also
  modify  the ICM and examine different parameters of the histogram betting function.
  We evaluate the  proposed approach on three benchmark datasets, namely STAGGER,
  SEA and ELEC, presenting  different measures of its performance and comparing it
  with existing methods in the literature.
